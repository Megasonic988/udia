## Philosophy

I believe that software is not beautiful because the final engineering solution is perfect, but because the development
process reflects the human condition. Software, like all things in life, exist just like your definition of your
own self exists.

Software as art cannot be owned! You cannot own your great-great-grandfather, or your country, or own omnipotence.

They are ideas.

Anyways, here's a web app.

## Requirements

- NodeJS (v6.9.1)
- MongoDB (v3.2)
